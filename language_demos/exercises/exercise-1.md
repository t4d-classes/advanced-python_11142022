# Exercise 1

1. Create a new Python file named `business_days.py` in new folder named `rates_demo`. The `rates_demo` folder should be placed in the `language_demos` folder. Do all coding for the exercise in the `business_days.py` file.

2. Create a function named "business_days" that returns the business days between a start date and an end date. The date range should be inclusive of the start and end date.

- Your choice, but you can do this by producing a list or you may use a generator

3. A business day is defined as any date that is not a weekend or a US holiday. Explore the [holidays](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) package on PyPi.org to figure out how to determine US holidays.

4. Using the "business_days" function display a listing of all business days between the start and end date in the console. Please display one date per line.
